## Report
* **[P0]** Provide small tips based on results
* **[P0]** Show details of cookies and webbeacaon found

## Website :

* **[P0]** Putting it into production

# Distribution

* *[P3]* Put the software in a package manager (*pip*, *snap*, etc)
* **[P0]** Create a website to allow the use of the software directly on it, without any installation
